Hi there, it's Folasewa. I am a recent graduate student of Obafemi Awolowo University. I studied Computer Science with Mathematics. I aim to apply the knowledge gained in the classroom to research and development in the Biomedicine sector. My interests lie in blood disorders and therapeutic genome editing.

While I am just trying to break into this new field, I am currently starting personal projects on Machine Learning. You can check them on my GitHub page
 I am open to collaborations, projects, and internships to learn, grow, and contribute to academia and industry.

While I am not reading, I am watching Kdrama or listening to music.
You can reach me through my email address, abdulsalammaryam381@gmail.com
