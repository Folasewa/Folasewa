Hi there, it's Folasewa. 

I am currently studying in a master's program in Neuroscience and Data science.

From October 2024 to 2026, my GitHub activities will feature projects in Deep Learning, Signal Processing, Neural Decoding, and Neuropharmacology.

I see this space as a learning period and I hope you can track my learning growth through this platform.

I am open to summer internships in BCI/Neuroscience/Data Science.
